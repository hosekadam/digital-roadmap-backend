    Same payload as the v1 relevant upcoming changes endpoint. The inventory
    query is limited to these ids and to the groups this caller may read. Ids
    the caller cannot read are omitted. The query reads installed packages,
    because a host matches an item only when its RHEL major equals the item's
    major and its package names intersect the item's package set.

    With all=false, only items that match at least one host in this request
    are returned. An item that matches only a host left out of the request is
    absent. With all=true, every known item is returned, and affected systems
    are still only hosts from this request. To match one request for all
    accessible hosts when processing batches, merge rows that share a name and
    release, union the affected systems, and count each host once. Drop a row
    that has no affected systems when all=false, then recalculate metadata.
    Concatenating responses is not enough. Item names stay the same across
    batches because they come from the upcoming file.
