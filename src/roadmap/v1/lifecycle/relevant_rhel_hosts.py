    """Return RHEL lifecycle data for the given hosts.

    Same payload as the v1 relevant RHEL endpoint. The inventory query is
    limited to these ids and to the groups this caller may read. Ids the
    caller cannot read are omitted. The query reads host IDs, display names,
    OS fields (including os_release), and installed products, but not packages
    or DNF modules.

    With related=true, related versions are calculated for the hosts in this
    request. A version returned as related may be installed on a host left out
    of the request; including that host leaves the version out of the related
    set and returns it on that host's installed lifecycle row. Each related
    row comes from one lifecycle record for that version and always uses
    lifecycle type mainline, so its identity stays the same across batches.
    Installed lifecycle types stay on their own rows. To match a request for
    all accessible hosts when processing batches, merge installed rows that
    share an OS name, version, and lifecycle type, counting each host once.
    Drop a related version when any batch has that version installed, then
    recalculate metadata. Concatenating responses is not enough.
